    Ainsley Brundage is an aspiring Software Engineer and amateur boxer born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. He is currently enrolled in Fullstack Academy's Future Code Web Development Fellowship. Ainsley is seeking to bridge the diversity gap in web development, demystify the myths surrounding tech; which create psychological barriers for BIPOC, and develop applications that make life just a little bit better in an increasingly digital world. When he's not coding, you can find him in Chelsea Piers Fitness working up a sweat or anywhere there is good food and good music.
